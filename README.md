Hi, I'm hirobuda(or Buda/Hiroshi/whatever). I'm a undergraduate student in Applied Mathematics 
and Scientific Computing at [ICMC-USP](https://www.icmc.usp.br/). I'm currently working with [GNNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_neural_network)
and image processing. Also, I recently became interested in category/type theory(a confusing yet beautiful piece of math)
and functional programming(a beautiful yet confusing piece of computing). よろしくお願いします！
